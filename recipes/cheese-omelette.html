    <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set.
